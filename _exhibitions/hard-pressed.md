Hard Pressed is an experimental community arts project spanning WA and the NT. Community groups, artists and members of the public created large-scale woodcuts.

These were printed with a ‘steamroller’ on the Geraldton Foreshore in a celebration of unconventional printmaking.

Hard Pressed has been on display in Geraldton and will travel to Fremantle after the Esperance exhibition.
