    <h1>About Cannery Arts Centre</h1>
    <p>
      Located on the beautiful Esperance foreshore, the Cannery Arts Centre was built originally to be used as a Fish Cannery in 1949.  After serving as a car yard, a dance hall and a youth centre it was renovated in 1984 to its present state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now a vibrant community arts centre delivering facilities, exhibitions, and workshops to the Esperance region and its visitors. The Cannery Arts Centre is a not-for-profit organisation run by a volunteer committee. This unique facility relies on fundraising, sponsorship and income from art sales and venue hire.
